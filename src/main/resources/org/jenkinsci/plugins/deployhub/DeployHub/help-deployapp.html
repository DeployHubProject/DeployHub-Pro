Check this box if you want <I>DeployHub</I> to deploy an application following a successful build. If you select this box, options will be presented allowing you to
select an application and a target environment. If you leave this box unchecked, Jenkins will simply inform <I>DeployHub</I> that a build has been performed but a
deployment will not occur. This allows <I>DeployHub</I> to track builds against components.
