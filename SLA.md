# Support Services Agreement

This Support Services Agreement ("Agreement') sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to the provision by DeployHub of maintenance and support services (the “Support Services”) for DeployHub
software separately licensed to you by DeployHub, Inc “DeployHub”, (the "Maintained Software") and for which you have paid the applicable annual maintenance fee. All software, documentation and media
provided to you under the terms and conditions of this Agreement are also subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable DeployHub Software License Agreement relating to the Maintained
Software.

## TERM AND TERMINATION

This Agreement will become effective and Support Services provided hereunder will commence when DeployHub receives your order for Support Services. DeployHub may terminate this Agreement in the event
your payment of the applicable annual maintenance fee for such order is not received within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Support Services provided hereunder will cease on the last day of the maintenance period which is twelve (12) months from the commencement of Support Services under this Agreement. This
Agreement may be terminated at any time upon fifteen (15) days written notice by either party to the other party by reason of any violation of any material terms and conditions of this Agreement.

## WHAT YOU RECEIVE AS AN DEPLOYHUB SUPPORT SERVICES CUSTOMER

### Telephone & Email Support

DeployHub responds to Customer requests for Support by telephone, facsimile, on line service (if available) or in writing to Customer from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm Eastern Standard Time, Monday through
Friday excluding national Holidays. Customer can request weekend or Holiday support on an "as needed" basis by submitting the request in writing to DeployHub.

### Correction to Reported Defects

DeployHub will, with your assistance in providing sufficient information and the minimum length source code sufficient for DeployHub to reproduce the suspected Defect, investigate a suspected Defect
in the then current release or immediately prior release of the Maintained Software by attempting to reproduce it. If the Defect is confirmed, DeployHub will use reasonable efforts to provide a
Correction via temporary product fix or in a future release. When provided under this Agreement, such Correction will be provided without additional charge. DeployHub reserves the right to discontinue
Support Services without notice on a past Correction for any Maintained Software after you receive or are given access to a new release, new version or subsequent maintenance release of the Maintained
Software containing that Correction is available. Defects are defined as defects in the distribution media or material differences between the operation of the Maintained Software and the description
of the operation of the Maintained Software as provided in the applicable end-user documentation. Corrections include, but are not limited to, workarounds, support releases, update disks, correction
disks, component replacements, patches and/or documentation changes, as DeployHub deems appropriate.

### Updates

Provided that you have paid to DeployHub any applicable annual maintenance fees and charges, you will be entitled to receive from DeployHub all new releases, new versions, Corrections, enhancements
and improvements to the Maintained Software to the extent that the same are made generally available to other DeployHub Support customers.

## ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND CHARGES

DeployHub reserves the right, after prior notice, to charge for services which are not the result of Defects in the Maintained Software. Examples of potentially billable services include: Debugging,
application coding errors in a customer's application; and Debugging problems in non-Maintained Software, or in combinations of Maintained Software and non-supported products, where the problem occurs
in the non-supported product.  
DeployHub may offer under separate agreements additional maintenance-related services, such as training and consulting. Such services can be performed at a site and time mutually agreeable. These
services are normally charged on a time and materials basis plus expenses and are subject to availability.

## ITEMS NOT COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT

The following are excluded from the Support Services:

* Altered or modified Maintained Software unless altered or modified pursuant to this Agreement or another Services Agreement with DeployHub;
* Any combination of Maintained Software and other software not covered by this Agreement or not authorized by DeployHub;

* Defects that do not impair or affect the operation of the Maintained Software; and
* Maintained Software used on an unsupported computer or operating system.

## MAINTENANCE RENEWAL

The first annual maintenance fee shall be paid in accordance with Item 1 above. Annual maintenance fees for new annual maintenance periods must be paid in advance on or prior to each anniversary of
the commencement of Support Services. Approximately forty-five (45) days prior to the termination of the then current annual maintenance period, DeployHub will invoice you for the next year's renewal
of the Support Services. The annual maintenance fee due for the next maintenance period shall be the then current applicable DeployHub list price for the renewal of annual Support Services as of the
date of invoice.  
DeployHub reserves the right to withdraw Support Services on any or all Maintained Software, and to alter the prices, terms and conditions for the Support Services in advance of any renewal of Support
Services. Any such withdrawal or alterations will amend this Agreement between you and DeployHub as of such renewal date.

## MAINTENANCE RE-INSTATEMENT

If you allow the Support Services to expire, in order to reinstate Support Services for a 12-month term for the applicable Maintained Software you must pay to DeployHub: if you are licensing the then
current release of such Maintained Software, a fee equal to the then current annual maintenance fee for the applicable copy of the Maintained Software, plus the then current annual maintenance fee
prorated for the period extending back to the date of expiration of Support Services; or if you are not licensing the then current release of such Maintained Software, a fee equal to the then current
annual maintenance fee for the applicable copy of Maintained Software, plus the then current upgrade fee for the current release of the Maintained Software.

## EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES

NEITHER DeployHub NOR ANY OF ITS THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY, LOSS OR DAMAGE, WHETHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL, ARISING OUT OF THE SUPPORT SERVICES OR
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE MAINTAINED SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, DATA OR PROGRAMS, AND THE COST OF RECOVERING SUCH DATA OR PROGRAMS, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.

## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

DEPLOYHUB’S cumulative liability to you for any loss or damages resulting from any claims, demands, or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall not exceed the license fee paid by you
to DEPLOYHUB for the use of the Software under this Agreement. In no event shall DEPLOYHUB be liable for any (a) indirect, punitive, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages or lost
profits, (b) loss of use of any computer or loss or corruption of data or the costs of system or data recovery, or (c) third party claims. The limitations contained in this paragraph apply whether the
liability is based on contract, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, even if DEPLOYHUB has been advised of the possibility of such damages. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION
OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

this Agreement against the other party regarding the subject matter hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any other relief granted, reasonable attorney fees and
