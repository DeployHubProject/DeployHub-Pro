Release Engineer is a Free Application Release Automation solution based on resusable modules or "playbooks" that can be shared across the general software development community. Its features include the ability to package your software deployment, perform the deployments without the need for end target agents, setup calendars, manage your server configurations and integrate with your CI server such as Jenkins.

The Release Engineer Jenkins Plugin will enable Jenkins to interact with Release Engineer.  This interaction extends Jenkins to perform deployments via Release Engineer.
