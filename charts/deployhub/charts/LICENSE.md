    When measured by the number of Applications supported by the Software, each license may be used on any number of computers owned, leased or otherwise controlled by you, and by any number of users, provided each license supports a single Application.  

    The Software may only be used in accordance with the Documentation.  You will not, and will not permit others to: (a) copy the Software or Documentation, other than copying in compliance with the level of use authorized or making one copy of the Software for backup or archival purposes; (b) use the Software or Documentation other than as permitted in this Agreement; (c) use the Software to process the data of a third party; (d) modify, disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile or translate the Software or the Documentation; (e) sell, assign, sublicense, lease, pledge, rent or otherwise share your rights under this Agreement; (f) create any derivative works based upon the Software or Documentation; or (g) modify, obscure or remove any proprietary notices on the Software, the Documentation or copies thereof.
